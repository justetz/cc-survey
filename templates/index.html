                <h1>RPI Counseling Center Survey</h1>
                <p class="lead">The Counseling Center subcommittee of the Student Life Committee has compiled this short survey to gather larger student sentiment towards the mental health facilities at Rensselaer. This brief survey aims to gather the student opinion on the quality of care and the ease of access of counseling at RPI.</p>

                    <h2>Completely anonymous</h2>
                    <p>While this survey requires that students log in using a valid RCS user ID, the survey itself is completely anonymous. The login is merely used to authenticate that survey participants are affiliated with RPI, and all personally-identifiable user information is deleted after the session is complete. An irreversible hash of your RCS ID is recorded to ensure that the survey is taken only once, and this hash is not linked to your survey response.</p>

                    <h2>Get involved</h2>
                    <p>The Student Life Committee would like to thank you for your participation in the survey and your contribution to improving the student experience at Rensselaer. If any students would like to participate in the subcommittee, meetings are held at 6 pm on Tuesdays in the Student Government Suite.</p>
